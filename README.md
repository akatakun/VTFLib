VTFLib
======

This is a Linux port of [VTFLib](http://nemesis.thewavelength.net/index.php?c=149).

### Setup

	git clone https://github.com/panzi/VTFLib.git
	mkdir VTFLib/build
	cd VTFLib/build
	cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DUSE_LIBTXC_DXTN=[ON|OFF] -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=[ON|OFF]
	make -j`nproc`
	sudo make install

You may use the cmake option `-DUSE_LIBTXC_DXTN=ON`/`OFF` to enable/disable
support for writing S3TC compressed textures.

### Missing Features

There are several features that aren't currently supported by the Linux
version because they depend on a legacy Windows library
([nvDXTLib](http://developer.nvidia.com/object/dds_utilities_legacy.html)).
Such features are:

 * genratig mipmaps
 * resizing textures and generating thumbnails
 * generating normal maps/normal map conversion

However, all read-only features are supported.

### Dependencies

 * [libtxc\_dxtn](http://cgit.freedesktop.org/~mareko/libtxc_dxtn/) for writing S3TC
   compressed textures (optional).

### Documentation
